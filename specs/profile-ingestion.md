# Profile Ingestion Pipeline Specification

## Overview

The pipeline builds a ResearcherProfile from three sources: ORCID (profile, grants, publications), PubMed (abstracts, optionally full-text methods), and user-submitted content. It produces structured profile fields via LLM synthesis.

## Triggers

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|
| User creates account with ORCID | Full pipeline |
| User adds/modifies/deletes submitted text | Re-synthesize profile (don't re-fetch publications unless stale) |
| User clicks "refresh profile" | Full pipeline |
| Monthly cron detects new ORCID works | Generate candidate profile, notify user if arrays changed |
| Admin seeds profile with ORCID ID | Full pipeline (no user interaction) |

## Pipeline Steps

### Step 1: Fetch ORCID Profile

```
GET https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/{ORCID-ID}/record
Accept: application/json
```

Extract:
- Full name (given-names + family-name)
- Current affiliation (from employments)
- Lab website (from researcher-urls)
- Email (if public)

### Step 2: Fetch ORCID Grants

```
GET https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/{ORCID-ID}/fundings
Accept: application/json
```

Extract grant titles from each funding entry. Store on profile as `grant_titles` array.

### Step 3: Fetch Publications from ORCID Works

```
GET https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/{ORCID-ID}/works
Accept: application/json
```

The user has curated their publication list on ORCID. Pull the works list and extract PMIDs/DOIs for each entry. This eliminates author name disambiguation — if a paper is on their ORCID, they've claimed it.

**Fallback for sparse ORCID:** If the ORCID works list has fewer than 5 entries, nudge the user to update their ORCID profile rather than falling back to PubMed name search. Display: "We found [N] publications on your ORCID profile. For the best collaboration matching, please ensure your ORCID is up to date at orcid.org."

### Step 4: Fetch Abstracts from PubMed

Using PMIDs from the ORCID works list, batch fetch PubMed records:

```
GET https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&id={PMID1},{PMID2},...&rettype=xml&retmode=xml
```

For each publication, extract and store as a Publication entity:
- PMID, PMCID (if available), DOI
- Title
- Abstract
- Journal
- Year
- Author position (first, last, middle) — determined from the author list in the PubMed record
- Article type (research article, review, editorial, etc.)

Store all publications. For profile synthesis, use the most recent 25-30 research articles (not reviews/editorials/commentaries), prioritizing last-author papers.

### Step 5: Deep Mining (Default On)

Fetch methods sections from PMC for open-access papers to extract specific techniques, cell lines, mouse strains, protocols, and reagents.

1. Identify which publications have PMCIDs (from Step 4 or via ID conversion):
   ```
   GET https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/utils/idconv/v1.0/?ids={PMID1},{PMID2},...&format=json
   ```

2. Fetch full text for open-access papers:
   ```
   GET https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id={PMCID}&rettype=xml
   ```

3. Extract the methods/materials section from the XML.

4. Store as `methods_text` on the Publication entity.

Deep mining is on by default. It is slower (minutes vs seconds) but produces significantly more specific profiles, which directly improves matching engine output quality.

### Step 6: Collect User-Submitted Texts

Retrieve any user-submitted texts from the profile. These are stored as `user_submitted_texts` on ResearcherProfile — an array of {label, content, submitted_at} objects.

### Step 7: LLM Synthesis

Call the LLM (Claude Opus) with the assembled context to generate structured profile fields.

**Input to LLM:**

```
Researcher Information:
- Name: [name]
- Affiliation: [institution, department]
- Lab Website: [url, if available]

Grant Titles:
- [grant title 1]
- [grant title 2]
- ...

Publications (most recent 25-30 research articles, last-author prioritized):
- [title] ([journal], [year]) [last author / first author]
  Abstract: [abstract text]
- ...

Methods Sections (where available):
- From "[paper title]":
  [methods text excerpt]
- ...

User-Submitted Texts:
- [label]: [content]
- ...
```

**Prompt instructions for synthesis:**

- Generate a research summary of 150-250 words as a narrative that connects themes, not a list of topics
- Weight user-submitted text as reflecting current priorities — it may diverge from the publication record
- Weight recent publications more heavily than older ones
- Be specific: "CRISPR-Cas9 screening in K562 cells" not just "CRISPR"
- For computational labs, list databases and computational resources as experimental models
- Extract specific molecular targets, not just pathways
- Do NOT quote or reference user-submitted text directly in any output — the profile must be justifiable from publicly available information

**Output schema:**

```json
{
  "research_summary": "150-250 word narrative",
  "techniques": ["technique1", "technique2", ...],
  "experimental_models": ["model1", "model2", ...],
  "disease_areas": ["area1", "area2", ...],
  "key_targets": ["target1", "target2", ...],
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...]
}
```

**Field-specific guidance (carried over from Science Profiler skill):**

**Techniques:** Look for sequencing methods (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, single-cell RNA sequencing), imaging (confocal microscopy, cryo-ET, live-cell imaging), biochemistry (mass spectrometry, proteomics, CRISPR screens), computational (machine learning, network analysis, knowledge graphs), molecular biology (gene editing, cloning, reporter assays), cell biology (flow cytometry, organoid culture), structural (X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, NMR), in vivo (behavioral testing, metabolic phenotyping).

**Experimental Models:** Model organisms, specific cell lines (including variants), transgenic/knockout models with strain names, patient samples, and for computational labs: databases, knowledge graphs, text corpora.

**Disease Areas:** Use standardized terms. For basic science labs, list biological processes/systems rather than diseases.

**Key Targets:** Specific proteins, enzymes, receptors, transcription factors, pathways, gene families, molecular systems.

**Keywords:** Additional terms not already captured in other fields. Draw from MeSH terms. Optional — listing none is acceptable.

### Step 8: Validation

Before saving, check:
- Research summary is 150-250 words
- At least 3 techniques listed
- At least 1 disease area or biological process listed
- Key targets array is present (may be empty)

If validation fails: re-run synthesis once with stricter prompt. If it fails again, save what we have and flag for review.

### Step 9: Store

- Parse LLM output into structured fields
- Save to ResearcherProfile
- Bump `profile_version`
- Compute and store `raw_abstracts_hash` (hash of all abstract texts used as input)
- Set `profile_generated_at` to now

## Monthly Refresh Cron

1. For each user with an ORCID: re-fetch ORCID works list
2. Diff against stored Publication records
3. If new works found:
   a. Fetch abstracts for new publications
   b. Run deep mining for new publications
   c. Store new Publication entities
   d. Run LLM synthesis with updated publication set → candidate profile
   e. Compare candidate arrays against current arrays (techniques, experimental_models, disease_areas, key_targets, keywords, grant_titles)
   f. If any array differs: store as `pending_profile`, notify user
   g. If no arrays differ: no action needed (new publication stored but profile unchanged)
4. Refresh frequency is configurable (default: monthly). No regeneration if nothing changed.

## API Rate Limits

### ORCID API
- No authentication required for public data
- Rate limit: 24 requests/second, 10,000/day

### NCBI E-utilities (PubMed/PMC)
- Without API key: 3 requests/second
- With API key: 10 requests/second
- Get key at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/settings/
- The app should use an API key for all NCBI requests

## Edge Cases

### Computational vs Wet-Lab Profiles
For computational/bioinformatics labs:
- "Experimental models" includes databases, knowledge graphs, text corpora, claims data
- "Techniques" focuses on computational methods, algorithms, analysis approaches

### Sparse ORCID Data
If ORCID has minimal works:
- Nudge user to update ORCID
- Profile can still be generated from grants + any available publications + user-submitted text
- Flag profile as potentially incomplete

### Publications Without PMIDs
Some ORCID works may only have DOIs. Use NCBI ID converter or CrossRef to resolve to PMIDs where possible. If no PMID available, store with DOI only and skip abstract fetch for that paper.
